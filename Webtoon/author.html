					<h1>The Origin Story</h1>
						<div class="about">
							<p>Once upon a time, three people were brought together by random chance, on a day that was kind of average actually. It was like in the seventies , which is like in the twenties for literally anyone outside the US. </p>
							
							<p>First came E-Sponge, who was torn from her family in a freak dish washing accident. Although harrowing, she made it through the hard times by having an overwhelmingly positive attitude. And there was Fruit Punch, who came from the far corners of the Amazon. He destroys fruits for a living. He claims it's for the children. And then there was the Narrator. Despite early disputes due to creative differences, they came through. They’re cool.</p>

							<p>The authors all saw each other simultaneously, and thought, we should make a  comic, but like, relatable. Because that’s never been done before.</p>

							<p>Obviously.

							<p>And so they met up on Mt. Everest the very next day, to think of what direction to take this moment of inspiration. It seemed they were going nowhere, probably because they were on Mt. Everest and it’s extremely cold and hard to breathe in elevated areas without being acclimated to the conditions through long periods extending through multiple weeks, but they managed.</p>

							<p>Once they came down from Mt. Everest, they found themselves enlightened to perspectives they’d never even imagined. It was great. </p>

							<p>With their combined intellects, they were successfully able to create something beyond mortal comprehension, revolutionary, far beyond its time. It was relatable compounded by relatable. And it had cute little characters. </p>

							<p>And thus, Read More was born.*
										
							<p id="asterisk">*Slightly exaggerated

							<p>Our rich history aside, we think you should really consider reading our comic. It takes work.</p>
